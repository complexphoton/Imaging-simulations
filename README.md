# Imaging simulations

## Introduction
This repository contains the code for performing large-scale full-wave simulations of several scattering-based imaging methods:

- Scattering matrix tomography ([SMT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08793)) in reflection mode
- Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM)
- Optical coherence tomography (OCT)

- Synthetic OCT
- Synthetic OCM

We use the scattering matrix to perform numerical modeling. The scattering matrix encapsulates the sampleâ€™s complete linear response. Given the scattering matrix of the sample, we can obtain the scattering field from arbitrary input and model any scattering-based imaging method. More importantly, the computation of scattering matrices is accelerated by several orders-of-magnitude thanks to the introduction of a new technique called [augmented partial factorizaion](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-022-00370-6), making it possible to perform the full-wave simulation on a large system. Such numerical modeling can be helpful for developing new imaging methods by providing the ground truth, the flexibility to tailor the system and the imaging scheme, and the ease of comparing different methods.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
The code is written in MATLAB so no compilation is required. But you will need the following dependencies to run different components of the code:

- System setup: [MESTI](https://github.com/complexphoton/MESTI.m), [METIS](http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/metis/overview) (optional, a package for producing the matrix ordering)
- Reflection matrix computation: [MESTI](https://github.com/complexphoton/MESTI.m), [MUMPS](https://mumps-solver.org/index.php)
- Image reconstruction: [MESTI](https://github.com/complexphoton/MESTI.m), [FINUFFT](https://finufft.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Note that if you plan to use one component of the code, there is no need to install dependencies of other components.

Later we may add an option in the image reconstruction code to use the [nufftn](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/double.nufftn.html) from MATLAB, which does not require the compilation of FINUFFT but is slower.

### Install Dependencies

#### MESTI

MESTI is required for all components of the code. The installation of MESTI is straightforward. Simply download the source code from [here](https://github.com/complexphoton/MESTI.m/tree/main/src) and add it to the MATLAB search path.

#### METIS

METIS produces high-quality orderings for matrix factorization, which accelerates the reflection matrix computation. In our large system, the computation time is shorten by 20%.

Download the source code from [here](http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/metis/download). No need to use the OpenMP version. You can compile METIS using the default option:
```
$ make config
$ make
```

Once the compilation is finished, you can find the METIS library under ```metis-x.x.x/build/*/libmetis```. The library path and header file path (```metis-x.x.x/include/```) will be used later for the compilation of MUMPS. There is no need to add METIS to the MATLAB search path. 

#### MUMPS

The detailed instructions for compiling MUMPS can be found [here](https://github.com/complexphoton/MESTI.m/tree/main/mumps). Be cautious that the compilation of MUMPS and its MATLAB interface can take significant effort.

#### FINUFFT

Download the source code from [here](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/finufft/releases). There are two routes to compile: the new CMake-based route and the old GNU makefile-based route. Note that the CMake-based route is still [under development](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/finufft/pull/254), which does not support many building options. You can take the makefile-based route for now.

There is a caveat in compiling the MATLAB interface on Mac. You may get a warning of ```license has not been accepted``` from Xcode and a following error of ```no supported compiler was found```. The same error can happen to the MUMPS MATLAB interface. The simple [solution](https://finufft.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#the-clang-route-default) is typing 

```
$ /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c 'Add :IDEXcodeVersionForAgreedToGMLicense string 10.0' ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dt.Xcode.plist
```
in the command line. 

Remember to add ```finufft-x.x.x/matlab``` to the MATLAB search path after the compilation.


After installing the required dependencies above, you can simply download the code and add all folders to the MATLAB search path. Make sure that the working directory is ```/path/to/Imaging-simulations``` when you run the code.

## Getting Started
To get started, we suggest running the image reconstruction code for the system described in our paper. After downloading the precomputed reflection matrix, ```system_data.mat``` file and moving them to ```Image-simulations/data/large_system```, you can use  ```recon_all.m``` to reconstruct all images. Before running the script, make sure that the working directory is ```/path/to/Imaging-simulations``` and all scripts are in the MATLAB search path. It takes less than one minute to reconstruct each image on a MacBook Air with Apple M1 chip.  

After obtaining the reconstructed images, you may download the z-dependent weights and use the ```scripts/plotting/plot_all_images.m``` to plot all images.

Later we will upload a small system for testing. All the computation of the small-system example can be done on a laptop.

## Usage

Here, we give an overview of the functionality and usage of all components. For more detailed information, please refer to comments at the beginning of each script. 

### System Setup
This component (```Imaging-simulations/scripts/system_setup```) builds the system and outputs a ```system_data.mat``` file, which contains all the necessary data for reflection matrix computation and image reconstruction. In addition, it also outputs METIS ordering files if METIS is installed and the option of producing METIS orderings is set to true.

To build the system, you should first create a directory 
```data_dir``` and a script ```data_dir/set_simulation_parameters.m```. All the simulation parameters shall be defined in that script. You can use our sample systems as the template. The ```data_dir``` will be used later for saving all simulation data of this system, including the reflection matrices and reconstructed images. In this repository, we use ```data_dir=Imaging-simulations/data/[system_name]```. After defining the parameters, you can specify your ```data_dir``` in ```build_system.m``` and run the script. The script builds the system and saves all relevant data in ```data_dir/system_data.mat```. It also saves optional METIS ordering files under ```data_dir/orderings```.


### Reflection Matrix Computation

This component (```Imaging-simulations/reflection_matrix_computation```) computes hyperspectral angular/spatial reflection matrices. There are three scripts in this componenet. The ```compute_angular_R.m``` computes angular reflection matrices at multiple frequencies while ```compute_spatial_R.m``` computes a subset of the spatial reflection metrics at multiple frequencies. The ```planckwin.m``` is used for generating a Planck-taper window profile for smoothing the line source profile.

The R computation function loads necessary data from ```system_data.mat``` and the METIS orderings if exist.  After the computation is done, the reflection matrix will be saved under ```data_dir/hyperspectral_reflection_matrices```. Note that reflection matrices are converted to single-precision for reducing the storage space and accelerating the image reconstrcution speed. 

### Image Reconstruction

This component (```Imaging-simulations/image_reconstruction```) consists of functions for reconstructing images from hyperspectral reflection matrices. Each function implements one or two imaging methods menitioned in the introduction section. 

To use those functions, you need to specify the data directory ```data_dir``` and/or the imaging method in the arguments. The function will load necessay data from ```data_dir/system_data.mat``` and reflection matrices from ```data_dir/hyperspectral_reflection_matrices```, reconstruct the image, and save the reconstructed image data under ```data_dir/reconstructed_images```. Note that the image data is saved in single-precision, which is sufficient for most imaging applications. 


### Post-processing

This component (```Imaging-simulations/depth_dependent_weights```) generates depth-dependent weights for reducing the intensity variation across different image depths. The weight is an exponential function of a piecewise polynomial. The polynomial coefficients are determined by manual tuning to fit the maximum image intensity at each depth. 

The weight parameters for all images are defined in ```data_dir/z_z_dependent_weights/get_weight_parameters```. You specify the imaging method in the script. The script will generate the weight and plot the weight and the maximum image intensity at each depth. As a rule of thumb, you should tune the weight parameters such that trend of both curves matches. You can specify the option of saveing the weight to true after the tunning. The weight will be saved under ```data_dir/z_dependent_weights```.

### Plotting

This component (```Imaging-simulations/plotting```) consists of a script for plotting the ground truth and reconstructed images. Later we may add another component for computing the field profile and the corresponding plotting script.

You should specify the data directory ```data_dir``` and the list of imaging methods. If you have generated depth-dependent weights for those methods, you can set the option of applying weights to true. The script will load the image data from ```data_dir/reconstructed_images```, divide the image intensity by the depth-dependent weight if applicable, and plot the images. It also plots the ground truth if you includes "ground_truth" in the list of imaging methods. By setting the option of saving figures to true, you can save the JPEG image under ```Imaging-simulations/figs/[system_name]```.
